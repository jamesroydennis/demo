**HIPAA Compliance Considerations:**

This project is a simplified demonstration for interview purposes only and is not intended for production use. In a real-world healthcare application, strict HIPAA compliance measures would be implemented to protect Protected Health Information (PHI).

Key HIPAA principles, such as the Privacy Rule and Security Rule, govern the handling of PHI. This project uses simulated or anonymized data. In a production environment, we would implement:

* Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
* Access controls and audit logs.
* Secure authentication and authorization.

We have implemented basic data validation, such as LOINC code validation, to demonstrate the importance of data accuracy in healthcare.
